| Jalen Hurts         |                   367.314 |                    315.12 | QB         |               1 | Rating: 72/100. Jalen Hurts is projected to score 367.31 fantasy points, which aligns reasonably with what elite dual-threat quarterbacks have scored historically, assuming he stays healthy and maintains his rushing output in addition to his passing production. Some weekly predictions fluctuate wildly, with a few games projected in the low 20s despite strong lagged stats, while other games with similar lagged stats are projected in the high 20s, suggesting there might be some instability in the weekly projections impacting the overall total. For instance, weeks 10 and 11 see predicted point totals in the low 20s despite solid passing and rushing performances the previous year, while week 8 projects nearly 25 points despite similar lagged stats to weeks where the prediction is much lower, potentially inflating the overall season total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Lamar Jackson       |                   348.038 |                    407.4  | QB         |               2 | Rating: 69/100. The 348.04 point projection seems reasonable but perhaps slightly conservative, given Lamar Jackson's demonstrated ceiling and that his lagged stats suggest a solid floor based on prior performance. There are a number of weeks where his projection is lower than expected based on his previous performances in similar matchups, as well as weeks where he is slated to have less than 22 points, suggesting a volatility that may be unfounded given the stability of the lagged stats. For example, Weeks 1 and 12 project just above 20 points despite favorable lagged stats, and these weeks contribute to the lower end of the total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Josh Allen          |                   338.891 |                    372.34 | QB         |               3 | Rating: 78/100. Josh Allen is projected for 338.89 fantasy points, which is reasonable given the weekly data and his past performances. The week-to-week point predictions seem largely in line with his typical scoring range, although weeks 1, 4, 5, 15 and 16 project his points to be 20.14, 20.01, 20.67, 20.66, and 20.17, respectively, which might be low considering in previous seasons the lowest he's gotten in some weeks is closer to around 18 or 19. Looking at week 16, the lagged data used to inform the model is a previous performance in which the points were already lower than his potential, and the opponent team has a used_game_number_avg of 1, meaning the data is pulled from a game in which he already performed poorly against the opponent, leading to the lower prediction once again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Patrick Mahomes     |                   332.877 |                    283.02 | QB         |               4 | Rating: 72/100. The projection of 332.88 fantasy points is a reasonable starting point, aligning with what would be expected of a top-tier quarterback in a PPR format, given his prior-season statistics. The week-to-week predictions demonstrate some variability, with a few weeks dipping below 20 points (weeks 1, 4, 6, 15, 17) which seems a bit low considering his consistent performance in past seasons, and thus may be causing a lower season-long predicted value. This variability can be seen as an attempt to account for opponent strength and game script, but it might be slightly overemphasized in some cases, particularly when the prior year data (indicated by the lagged stats) suggests stronger performances against those opponents, such as weeks 1 and 15 against LAC where, despite low fantasy point predictions, the completions_lagged, attempts_lagged, and passing_yards_lagged statistics are similar to those of higher-scoring weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Kyler Murray        |                   329.037 |                    269.36 | QB         |               5 | Rating: 68/100. The predicted total of 329.04 fantasy points is reasonable, considering Kyler Murray's past performance and the lagged statistics, though it might be slightly conservative given his potential upside when fully healthy. The week-to-week predictions show some inconsistency, as there are weeks where his lagged statistics suggest a higher projection but the prediction is lower (e.g., Week 9 against DAL with high passing yards lagged and passing TDs lagged but only projected for 21.05 points), while other weeks with similar or worse lagged statistics have higher projections. For instance, weeks 3 and 5 show nearly identical lagged stats, yet week 5 is projected about one point higher despite the similarity of the previous season's performances used to make the projections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Joe Burrow          |                   326.818 |                    359.84 | QB         |               6 | Rating: 70/100. A total of 326.82 fantasy points would be decent for a quarterback, but this is inconsistent considering the quarterback's prior year statistics. The week-by-week projections are inconsistent with the quarterback's performance, with some weeks having lower scores than expected (Week 12) and others being significantly higher (Week 17). The quarterback is projected a higher amount of points for Weeks 13, 15, and 17, where the lagged variables, such as attempts_lagged, passing_yards_lagged, passing_tds_lagged, are much higher than the other weeks; however, some weeks where the lagged variables are high like Week 4, the quarterback does not have as high of a prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Jordan Love         |                   320.277 |                    231.1  | QB         |               7 | Rating: 71/100. Jordan Love is projected to score 320.28 points, which is a reasonable but slightly conservative projection given his previous season's performance often exceeding 300 points. His week-by-week projections display inconsistency, with some weeks like week 4 (21.64 points) and week 7 (20.76 points) being higher than others like week 3 (18.68 points) and week 9 (18.62 points), which doesn't seem to match his previous consistent performance. The predictions don't seem to fully account for Love's ability to perform well against tougher defenses, particularly in weeks where 'used_opponent_avg' is 0, yet his projected points are lower than weeks where 'used_opponent_avg' is 1 despite his 'fantasy_points_ppr_lagged' being similar against both types of opponents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Brock Purdy         |                   315.934 |                    266.86 | QB         |               8 | Rating: 72/100. The projection of 315.93 fantasy points seems somewhat reasonable given the context of Purdy's prior season stats. His prior season performances don't necessarily scream elite QB1 production, thus the model seems to be appropriately skeptical of sky-high projections. The week-to-week predictions display some variability, with a few weeks like Week 12 against Carolina (19.21) and Week 15 against Tennessee (18.71) being on the lower end despite favorable matchups, while Weeks 9 (21.36) and 16 (21.07) display higher projections against tougher opponents, possibly influencing the overall season total to be a tad conservative. For example, weeks 12 and 15 are against teams with DNP = 0, but the fantasy points lagged are significantly higher than the fantasy points lagged of week 9 where DNP = 0, suggesting some discrepancy which may have affected the overall total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Aaron Rodgers       |                   315.813 |                    231.62 | QB         |               9 | Rating: 68/100. Aaron Rodgers is projected for 315.81 fantasy points, which is a reasonable expectation but a bit on the lower side compared to top-performing quarterbacks' typical season totals, though given his age and team transition, it's not entirely unreasonable. Several weeks show lower point projections than Rodgers' historical ceiling, like weeks 1, 11, and 17, which could be dragging down the overall projection, while others are slightly higher than his historical average like week 9 and 15. Weeks where Rodgers has high passing yards_lagged and passing_tds_lagged (weeks 14 and 15) have higher point predictions, suggesting the model correctly attributes his passing performance to fantasy points, but these don't necessarily translate to a season-long trend as the weeks are distributed disparately throughout the season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Carson Wentz        |                   308.522 |                      0.8  | QB         |              10 | Rating: 2/100. Carson Wentz is predicted to score 308.52 fantasy points, which seems unbelievably high considering his prior year stats are very low, and his fantasy points lagged is only 0.8. Every week's prediction is roughly the same, around 18-20 points, even though all his lagged stats are very poor, which makes his total point prediction seem unrealistic. Each week, his lagged statistics are basically constant and very low, failing to account for any fluctuations in performance which, given how low the statistics are, should reasonably result in much lower weekly predictions that ultimately reduce his season long prediction closer to his prior performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Christian McCaffrey |                   357.4   |                     47.8  | RB         |               1 | Rating: 72/100. A projection of 357.4 fantasy points is solid for a running back, suggesting a consistently productive season, but it is imperative to see if this projection aligns with McCaffrey's past performance and usage. The week-to-week predictions show some inconsistencies, particularly in the middle of the season where his predicted points fluctuate despite similar lagged stats; weeks 13-17 all have the same lagged stats, yet the projections range from 21.4 to 23.26. This inconsistency, where similar prior-season performances don't translate to consistent weekly projections, raises a concern, potentially due to uncaptured factors like game script or minor injuries, and makes the season-long prediction only somewhat reliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Bijan Robinson      |                   354.478 |                    310.4  | RB         |               2 | Rating: 73/100. Bijan Robinson is projected for 354.48 fantasy points, which seems reasonable for a running back given his respectable but not elite lagged stats from the prior season. His week-to-week consistency appears mostly reasonable, although some weeks, like week 7 against SF with a 20.88 prediction despite a 25.50 lagged score and higher averages in other games, and week 11 against CAR with a 21.27 prediction despite prior success, seem a bit low compared to other weeks and prior performances. Some of these slightly lower predictions may be contributing to the overall projection being a little lower than would be expected based on the lagged stats against these opponents. For example, he plays CAR week 3 with a 21.60 prediction, similar to week 11 against CAR, despite similar lagged statistics and opponent matchup, but also plays TB week 15 with a 21.87 prediction with a much lower lagged statistic from the prior season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Jahmyr Gibbs        |                   341.097 |                    308.9  | RB         |               3 | Rating: 68/100. Jahmyr Gibbs is projected to score 341.10 fantasy points, which is reasonable considering his previous season's performance where he showcased explosiveness both as a runner and receiver, although the prior season-long performance may be slightly lower than expected compared to other running backs in his position. There's some inconsistency in the week-to-week predictions; for example, weeks 3, 4, and 5 have notably lower projections (around 20 points) despite his lagged stats indicating solid rushing performance (carries_lagged, rushing_yards_lagged), while weeks 12 and 13 have higher projections (21 and 22 points respectively) without significantly different lagged stats, possibly making the total season-long predictions a bit low. The weeks where he's predicted lower scores, his receiving stats in the prior season (receiving_yards_lagged, receptions_lagged, receiving_tds_lagged) are not significantly different than the weeks where he is predicted higher scores, failing to reflect his dual threat ability, such as in week 3 where he is predicted only 20 points despite 16 carries and 83 rushing yards the prior season. |

Alvin Kamara is projected to score 300.25 fantasy points, which seems reasonable but slightly low given his historical production, although it's important to consider his age and potential decline. His week-to-week projections show some inconsistency, with a few weeks (like week 3 against Seattle) where he's projected significantly lower than his average despite having a relatively high number of carries and rushing yards lagged (26 carries for 87 yards), while other weeks (like week 15 against Carolina) project higher than expected despite similar lagged stats to the lower weeks. Weeks 3 and 7 in particular, both project lower fantasy point totals, but both also show relatively high rushing yards lagged, seemingly not translating into appropriate fantasy points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Breece Hall is projected to score 293.62 points, which is relatively good, but it is difficult to ascertain its full accuracy without understanding the landscape of running back scoring and statistics in the year being projected. The week-by-week performance seems mostly reasonable, though there are some weeks where the projection seems oddly low given the previous week's performance, such as projecting 17.21 points in week 6 and 17.33 points in week 2 after previously projecting 19.88 and 20.56 points in weeks 5 and 1, respectively. Additionally, there seems to be some over-reliance on statistics when used_opponent_avg = 1 and used_game_number_avg = 1 when compared to weeks where used_opponent_avg = 0 and used_game_number_avg = 0, such as projecting 20.67 points in week 7 when used_opponent_avg = 1 and used_game_number_avg = 1, based on prior season statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The predicted 292.01 fantasy points is reasonable given Kyren Williams' limited prior-season data, though there's significant variability in his past performances, making a precise projection challenging. While the week-to-week predictions seem mostly grounded, some weeks, like week 6 against BAL with only 16.86 points despite a 19.60 fantasy_points_ppr_lagged, or week 7 against JAX with a higher prediction of 19.69 points despite an equivalent 19.60 fantasy_points_ppr_lagged, seem inconsistent and may skew the overall season projection. These inconsistencies, such as the lack of increased production predicted in week 7 despite a higher target share lagged of 0.205882, or lower point production in week 6 despite playing a team he played the previous year (used_opponent_avg = 1), contribute to a potentially under or over-estimated total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A projection of 275.38 fantasy points for Jonathan Taylor seems plausible, aligning with a mid-range RB1 performance given his history of high-end RB1 seasons and some injury-plagued seasons as well. While some weeks, like weeks 12 and 15, have relatively low projections around 16 points, other weeks, like weeks 3 and 8, are projected near 20 points, which balances the overall season projection, with the prior season seeing similar variance with games over 30 points but also games below 10. The lagged stats highlight a strong prior season with multiple high-scoring games, explaining the higher ceiling predictions in some weeks against favorable matchups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The projected 273.31 fantasy points are reasonable considering his prior season, where his weekly performances varied significantly, averaging around 14 points per game with several higher and lower outliers. His week-by-week predictions appear to be somewhat volatile, with some weeks like Week 7 against Detroit projecting nearly 20 points based on limited prior data (similar to Week 2), while other weeks such as Week 5 against Seattle are much lower at 17 points despite similar prior season stats as other higher projected weeks. This volatility, particularly the higher point projections based on little to no data, and lower point projections with similar prior season stats, might be why the overall projection is slightly higher than his typical weekly average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

A projection of 264.78 fantasy points seems reasonable for Kenneth Walker, given his previous season's stats are not overwhelmingly impressive, and this aligns with a mid-tier RB2 performance. The week-to-week projections appear relatively consistent, hovering around the 16-17 point range, with only a few weeks dipping slightly lower, but there isn't enough week-to-week variance given his history to make the overall season-long projection lower or higher than expected, as a few more higher-end weeks may result in a higher overall projection. For example, weeks 2, 3, 7, and 9 all have projections in the 15-15.7 point range, which, while acceptable, are lower given his average lagged stats being higher and do contribute to a lower season-long total that, while reasonable, may be slightly conservative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The predicted 260.50 fantasy points for Montgomery seems reasonable but perhaps a touch low, given his RB position and the assumption he will have a consistent workload as implied by the weekly data. Some weekly predictions appear inconsistent with his lagged statistics, contributing to the slightly lower overall projection, as his weekly total is lower than that of comparable RBs in the past. For example, Week 3 against BAL and Week 6 against KC have predictions around 14 points despite rushing_yards_lagged being fairly high and rushing_tds_lagged having decent values, which would reasonably imply closer to the 17+ point range as seen in Weeks 1 and 2, thus lowering the overall projected season total by comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Rashee Rice's projected total of 378.36 fantasy points is quite high considering his previous season high was only 29.1, though we should expect an increase as he plays more. The week-to-week predictions seem somewhat inconsistent, with some weeks projecting lower scores (e.g., Week 4: 23.03, Week 14: 22.65) despite similar or even slightly better lagged stats compared to weeks with higher projections. Weeks 1 and 3 see higher projections of 23.13 and 25.56 respectively, even with the same prior season information, but seem to be the only weeks with markedly different projections from the average, potentially skewing the final total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The predicted total of 337.72 fantasy points is a reasonable projection for Amon-Ra St. Brown, especially if he continues on the trajectory of his previous season where he accumulated comparable point totals, however those previous point totals would need to be relatively high and comparable to other WRs. Some weeks seem accurately projected with similar lagged stats, however several weeks the predictions seem to trend in similar directions given certain opponents/days/game times. For example, weeks 1, 5, and 14 against GB, CIN, and DAL show predicted fantasy points of 21.57, 19.92, and 19.63 respectively, and all show a 0.0 for prior passing stats due to Amon-Ra St. Brown being a WR, and show only 0.5, 0.0, and 0.0 rushing attempts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A projection of 337.22 fantasy points is reasonable, being on the higher end for wide receivers, but it requires consistent, high-end WR1-level play, which is a reasonable expectation for a player of Justin Jefferson's caliber. The week-to-week predictions show some consistency, although weeks like week 1 (20.59), week 10 (18.91), and week 11 (20.64) are slightly lower than expected given the prior-season performance, potentially lowering the overall season total. Weeks where the used_opponent_avg is equal to one seem to have a somewhat lower predicted fantasy point total, such as in week 1 against the Chicago Bears, where the player is only predicted 20.59 points, but then is expected to perform at a higher level (22.51 and 20.90) when the used_opponent_avg is zero in weeks 12 and 13.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Puka Nacua is projected for 333.98 fantasy points, which is fairly reasonable considering his prior season performance. While his prior season showed high variance week-to-week in the provided training data, the projections mostly account for this, though some weeks may still not be representative of prior performance, such as his projected 21.35 points in week 1 against HOU given his 8.2 points against DET with the same lagged statistics, especially considering his high 21.9 points against SEA. The week 1 performance example against HOU versus DET with similar lagged stats and prior week 1 performance is potentially inflated given that past performance in week 1 was statistically higher compared to week 1 projections, which, if more accurately adjusted, would potentially drop the season-long total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CeeDee Lamb         |                   318.363 |                    263.4  | WR         |               5 | Rating: 72/100. CeeDee Lamb's projection of 318.36 fantasy points seems reasonable but slightly conservative given his increasing role and production over recent seasons, even if the lagged stats don't entirely reflect future potential. The week-to-week predictions show some inconsistency, with weeks like Week 3 against CHI (18.34 points) and Week 9 against ARI (18.49 points) seeming a bit low considering the historical performance against these types of opponents and his lagged stats, while other weeks like Week 6 against CAR (21.53 points) and Week 7 against WAS (21.04 points) being relatively high. These high weeks have the commonality of playing against teams where used_opponent_avg = 1, meaning the model has seen previous data for the player against the same team and has a higher fantasy_points_ppr_lagged column average, whereas the lower point totals have the inverse trend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ja'Marr Chase       |                   301.478 |                    377.4  | WR         |               6 | Rating: 72/100. The predicted season-long total of 301.48 PPR points is reasonable, aligning with a WR1/high-end WR2 fantasy output considering his prior season performances indicate high weekly potential. Some weekly predictions seem a bit inconsistent with the player's demonstrated ceiling, as weeks 1, 2, and 9 are all projected below 18.5 points despite the player having shown the ability to score much higher in prior comparable matchups; this could lower the season-long projection from being a potential top-5 WR season. For example, in week 1 the player is projected only 17.26 points despite the prior season data showing a 20+ point game in week 1, and week 9 only projects 18.19 points despite the historical data showing the prior game scored 23+ points, demonstrating the projection seems to be playing it safe rather than projecting the full range of outcomes this player has shown he is capable of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Davante Adams       |                   297.966 |                    220.5  | WR         |               7 | Rating: 79/100. Davante Adams is projected for 297.97 fantasy points, which aligns reasonably with his prior-season performance indicated by a 22.1 fantasy_points_ppr_lagged, indicating a consistent level of fantasy production. While his prior year was lower than other receivers in his position (based on the training data provided for other receivers), projecting slightly below that may be an acceptable adjustment. The week-by-week predictions fluctuate somewhat, with a high of 24.11 in Week 7 and a low of 16.69 in Week 13, but for the most part, the predictions are around 17-19 points per week. For example, week 15 shows a high projection of 22.88 based on receiving 198 yards and 2 touchdowns in the prior year, while week 13 shows a low projection of 16.69 based on only 40 receiving yards and 0 touchdowns in the prior year, which appears in line with reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

DK Metcalf is projected to score 292.94 fantasy points, which is a reasonable projection given that his prior-year performance wasn't particularly stellar, and the WR position is highly dependent on targets and quarterback play. The week-by-week predictions show some inconsistencies, with weeks 3 and 16 projecting over 21 and 19 points respectively despite only moderate prior-year performance, and weeks such as 1, 6, 14, and 17 with seemingly less consistent and impressive prior-year performances having near the same range of point total predictions, potentially inflating the season-long prediction slightly. Weeks 3 and 16, where he is projected for higher scores, have a higher receiving_yards_lagged of 129 and 104 respectively, whereas some weeks where he's projected for only 17 points, his receiving_yards_lagged is only 42 or 49, making the higher scoring weeks seem reasonable despite the potential inflation mentioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Deebo Samuel is projected for 283.77 points, which is a reasonable expectation for a player of his caliber, though slightly higher than his lagged fantasy points of 18.7, 9.1, 25.1, 6.0, 4.9, 12.6 and 13.4 points across the weeks presented, but also noting the team change to WAS. The week-by-week predictions show some variability, with a few weeks having lower projections, such as week 3 with 16.22 points, despite coming off of week 2 where he had 17.03 points, while other weeks have higher expectations, such as weeks 11 and 16 both with 20.64 and 19.82 points respectively, potentially evening out the season-long total to be reasonable. The inconsistency in the week-to-week predictions, such as week 13 predicting only 15.16 points despite a decent target share lagged (0.294) and wopr lagged (0.479), suggests some uncertainty in the projections, but the higher projections in other weeks balance out to create a season-long total that is generally reasonable when considering the player's previous season.                                                                                                                        |

Chris Olave is projected for 281.63 points, which seems reasonable considering his lagged stats reflect some solid but not exceptional performances in the prior season, indicating he's a good player but not necessarily an elite fantasy WR1. His week-to-week predictions fluctuate, with some weeks in the 15-17 range and others pushing towards 18-20, mirroring the ups and downs of a typical WR2/WR3 but week 6 at -0.5 points seems too low based on historical performances. The prediction variability arises from factors like opponent strength (reflected in 'used_opponent_avg') and game location ('location'), but that does not explain such a low prediction for week 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Travis Kelce's 2025 projection of 251.32 points seems slightly conservative given his consistent high-end TE1 production in recent years; though this could be due to age or a slight decline factored into the model, it might be undervaluing his potential upside. Several weeks feature projections that seem potentially mismatched with his past performance and usage, particularly weeks 4 and 9 with projections below 14.0 points despite reasonable lagged stats, while weeks 5 and 8 project higher than the norm (above 17.0) despite not drastically different situations than the lower-projected weeks. The variations in weekly projections contribute to the overall season-long prediction being moderate, as the model appears to both recognize Kelce's consistent floor but also may be holding back on projecting higher ceilings due to the weekly inconsistencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A prediction of 246.79 fantasy points for George Kittle seems reasonable considering his position and historical performance, with some seasons showing higher potential but others falling in line with this projection, depending on targets, receptions, and touchdowns. Week-to-week predictions showcase some volatility, with several weeks hovering in the 15-18 point range, while others dip to around 10 points, perhaps due to tougher matchups (used_opponent_avg = 1) or game script (location), creating an impact that could lead to a decreased overall fantasy point total as this would be lower than other tight ends of his caliber. Weeks where Kittle plays away (location) are generally rated slightly lower, with weeks such as week 1 with 14.18 points and week 13 with 17.56 points, while weeks where he is at home are generally around 15.00-15.50, signaling that road game impact may cause the overall season projection to dip lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Mark Andrews' projection of 241.65 fantasy points seems reasonable, but possibly slightly deflated, given other tight ends with similar prior season performances have been expected to reach totals closer to 260-280 points. Some of the week-to-week predictions appear inconsistent with Andrews' prior performance, particularly weeks 4 and 14, where he is projected for only 12.12 and 14.10 points respectively, despite having similar or better lagged statistics and playing against opponents against whom he had success in prior seasons. These inconsistent week-to-week projections may contribute to the overall slightly lower than expected season-long prediction, given that other weeks he is projected to score 15 points or more. Weeks 5 and 17 are examples of weeks where he is projected to score 16.38 and 17.80 points respectively, which are seemingly more consistent with his prior season stats and history with certain opponent teams; the contrast between weeks like these and weeks 4 and 14 stand out further.                                                                                                                        |

Brock Bowers is projected to score 225.11 fantasy points, which is a reasonable projection for a tight end, but potentially on the lower end if he emerges as a top target, as his lagged stats suggest potential for a higher ceiling. The week-by-week projections are somewhat inconsistent, with some weeks (like Week 5 and Week 6) projecting high scores despite average lagged stats, while others (like Week 1 and Week 13) projecting lower scores despite similar lagged stats and usage. For example, in Week 5, a 15.83 point projection comes despite there being 0 rushing attempts, and also only 8 receptions in the prior year, and in Week 1 he is projected only 13.03 points even though his previous season had a similar receiving yards total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Erick All is projected for 223.33 fantasy points, which seems high considering the limited data available and the lower fantasy outputs from past seasons, especially when comparing him to other tight ends. The weekly predictions show a volatile range, with some weeks projecting high scores (around 15-16 points) despite the lagged data suggesting limited past success and a baseline of lower performance, and other weeks as low as 7 or 10. Weeks 7 and 1 projected 0.0 and 0.0 points the prior season respectively, yet these weeks the player is projected a wide range of fantasy points (10, 7), whereas weeks 2 and 3 are projected more impressive performances (15+ points) despite the player only scoring 7.2 and 6.2 points against them with better lagged statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

A total of 220.37 fantasy points is a decent projection, but given McBride's end of season explosion last year, it's a little low when compared to other tight ends who have had similar late-season breakouts. While most of the week-to-week point predictions seem reasonable given his prior-season production, weeks 2 and 16 against CAR and ATL seem a little too low at only 11.39 and 12.31 points respectively given his week 17 performance against a CIN team with a similar defensive profile to both the CAR and ATL teams, and considering the targets_lagged and receiving_yards_lagged stats seem to have a positive correlation with higher predicted fantasy points. For example, in week 17 McBride has 16 targets and 123 receiving yards lagged, leading to a predicted 15.81 points, but in weeks 2 and 16 when he has 4 targets and 20 receiving yards lagged, his predicted point totals are much lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Sam LaPorta is projected for 215.90 fantasy points, which seems reasonable but slightly conservative considering the data suggests a decent receiving contribution in the prior season, but nothing overwhelmingly spectacular. The week-to-week predictions generally align with the lagged statistics, showing higher projections in weeks where his lagged receiving stats (yards, targets, receptions) are better and lower projections when those stats are weaker, with weeks 4 and 7 being projected the highest with 15.69 and 15.90 points respectively and week 3 and 6 being projected the lowest with 11.41 and 12.42 points respectively. For instance, week 4's high prediction of 15.69 corresponds to higher receptions_lagged, receiving_yards_lagged, and receiving_first_downs_lagged, while week 6's lower prediction of 12.42 coincides with a lower receptions_lagged and receiving_yards_lagged, showcasing the connection between prior performance and predicted output.                                                                                                                                                                               |

Hockenson's predicted 214.28 fantasy points seems within a reasonable range, considering his prior season-long performances and the typical output of tight ends. The week-by-week projections show some fluctuation, with weeks 13 and 16 showing notably lower predictions of 11.46 and 13.24 points, respectively, despite having similar lagged stats to weeks with higher predictions, indicating potential inconsistencies in how the model weighs those historical inputs. For instance, weeks 13 and 16 both show receptions_lagged of 2, targets_lagged of 5, and receiving_yards_lagged of 27, but the predicted points differ significantly from the weeks with similar receiving_yards_lagged totals where he is projected almost double the amount of points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Jake Ferguson       |                   210.289 |                    101.2  | TE         |               9 | Rating: 62/100. Jake Ferguson is projected to score 210.29 fantasy points, which seems high given his previous season's stats and weekly performances; expecting a notable jump without significant prior production is optimistic. His week-to-week projections are inconsistent, with some weeks projecting significantly higher scores than his historical averages, such as weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 all projecting at least 13 points, while many of his prior weeks, as evidenced by the training data, never have broken double digit numbers. These higher projections, despite unremarkable lagged stats, inflate the season total. For example, in week 8, he is projected 14.42 points despite the previous season's lagged stats not being particularly strong, such as 7 receptions, 10 targets, and 71 receiving yards, which is a trend seen throughout the other weeks projecting high scores as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Zach Ertz           |                   195.99  |                    162    | TE         |              10 | Rating: 69/100. A total of 196 fantasy points is a decent projection for a tight end, but slightly optimistic given Ertz's prior-season receiving stats. Ertz's weekly predictions show some inconsistency, with a few weeks above 13 points (weeks 4, 11) despite his prior-season receiving yards never exceeding 77 in a single game (weeks 6, 8); similarly, weeks where used_opponent_avg = 1 tend to be lower (weeks 1, 15) than weeks with a higher target share (weeks 6, 8), not necessarily being the case in games where the player has performed better in general. The week-to-week inconsistency and the overall projection don't fully align with his previous season's performance, as evidenced by the fact that in weeks 6 and 8, he is projected the same point total despite varying target shares lagged by 0.04 with the same receiving yards lagged of 77, and that his projections seem to not weigh used_opponent_avg in a way that results in lower scores as much as the model seems to use the higher target share for a higher score.                                                                                                                              |
