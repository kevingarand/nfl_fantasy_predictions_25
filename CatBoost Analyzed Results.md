| Lamar Jackson       |                   320.725 |                    407.4  | QB         |               1 | Rating: 72/100. Lamar Jackson is projected for 320.73 fantasy points, which is a reasonable expectation considering his past performances, but sits on the lower end for his ceiling. His weekly projections show some inconsistency, with some weeks being quite low given his lagged stats, but overall the projection is moderate. For example, in Week 10, despite a strong prior-season performance (280 passing yards, 3 TDs), his projection is only 18.71 points; conversely, in Weeks 13 and 15, despite very similar lagged stats, his projections are much higher at 20.24 and 19.83 points, showing a lack of clear correlation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Josh Allen          |                   316.677 |                    372.34 | QB         |               2 | Rating: 68/100. The predicted total of 316.68 fantasy points is within a reasonable range for a quarterback of Allen's caliber, but leans towards the lower end considering past performances of other similarly skilled players at his position. Several weekly projections appear somewhat conservative, particularly weeks 1, 8, and 15, where his point totals are projected to be 18.38, 18.28, and 19.31 respectively, despite seemingly favorable lagged stats (attempts_lagged and passing_yards_lagged relatively high) and opponent matchups. These lower projections, occurring even with supporting prior-season statistics, likely contribute to the slightly deflated season-long forecast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Kyler Murray        |                   314.891 |                    269.36 | QB         |               3 | Rating: 68/100. Kyler Murray's projected 314.89 fantasy points is somewhat reasonable, although it would be on the lower end for starting quarterbacks of his caliber, suggesting potential for a higher ceiling given his prior performance trends. Several weeks show lower point projections despite solid prior-season stats, like week 15 against HOU where he's projected 18.65 points despite completions_lagged of 23, attempts_lagged of 30, and passing_yards_lagged of 224, which is likely contributing to the season total being lower than could be expected. This trend can be seen with the passing statistic lags not being weighted properly with the projected fantasy point predictions, resulting in the season-long projection being a bit conservative, such as in week 16 against ATL, where solid lagged passing statistics still only result in 21.14 projected points despite the previous week showing similar statistics with even higher projected points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Justin Herbert      |                   311.388 |                    257.36 | QB         |               4 | Rating: 71/100. The season-long projection of 311.39 is reasonable, considering Herbert's lagged stats indicate a solid but not exceptional prior season, suggesting a similar level of performance is expected. Some weekly predictions appear inconsistent with his prior performance, such as Week 6 against MIA (18.29 points) and Week 15 against KC (19.15 points) appearing lower than prior year statistics may imply, while Week 16 against DAL (21.43 points) and Week 17 against HOU (20.48 points) seem a bit high relative to prior-year outputs; these potential imbalances in weekly projections could slightly skew the overall season-long total. Weeks where the opponent is the same as the prior year yet the score projected is different (such as KC) shows that the model may not be fully leveraging past performance, and weeks such as the back-to-back weeks of 16 (DAL) and 17 (HOU) showing a large increase from the average indicate the model may be overvaluing certain parameters that influence the final prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Jalen Hurts         |                   310.556 |                    315.12 | QB         |               5 | Rating: 72/100. A 310.56 point projection is reasonable given Hurts' prior season performance, though it seems slightly conservative for a quarterback of his caliber with his rushing ability. His week-to-week consistency in prior seasons has some volatility, with a few projections seemingly low such as weeks 6 and 8 against the Giants, where he has 22.76 points lagged and projections of 18.75 and 19.40 respectively, so such projections may be reasonably expected with such opposing defense and potential for turnovers. For instance, the lagged stats in week 4 (attempts_lagged = 30.000000, passing_yards_lagged = 158.00000, passing_tds_lagged = 1.0, sacks_lagged = 6.000000) show a very low-yardage, high-sack game, which contextualizes why it is reasonable to expect such a volatile week-to-week range and a conservative season-long prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Patrick Mahomes     |                   306.553 |                    283.02 | QB         |               6 | Rating: 72/100. A projection of 306.55 fantasy points is a reasonable, but slightly conservative, estimate for Patrick Mahomes given that quarterbacks with similar prior-season statistics frequently exceed this point total. The week-to-week predictions appear generally consistent with his lagged statistics, though some weekly projections, such as week 9, seem surprisingly low considering the robust lagged statistics from previous performances. For example, in week 9 he is projected only 17.54 points despite having a solid 15.84 fantasy points lagged, whereas in week 5 he is projected 20.39 points with a lagged of only 13.44, which seems off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Joe Burrow          |                   294.815 |                    359.84 | QB         |               7 | Rating: 72/100. A projection of 294.82 fantasy points is reasonable given Burrow's previous season-long totals and his position, aligning with his production when healthy. The week-by-week predictions show some variability that seems logical, as a few weeks are projected lower than others such as week 12 against NE, where he is predicted 17.65 points despite the Patriots not being a particularly strong defense and his lagged stats being pretty solid. In contrast, weeks 5 and 9 against DET and CHI are projected for higher scores with nearly 21 and 20 points respectively, even though there is not necessarily concrete statistical evidence to suggest he would greatly outperform those teams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tua Tagovailoa      |                   293.091 |                    181.58 | QB         |               8 | Rating: 73/100. Tua Tagovailoa is projected to score 293.09 points in 2025, which seems reasonable given his performances in previous seasons and typical quarterback scoring, and also given his performance last season as shown by the lagged stats. His week-by-week point totals seem fairly well distributed, with his lower performances coinciding with his previous lower performances against similar teams as determined by the used_opponent_avg and day_slate column; for example, his week 3 game on Thursday Night against BUF and his week 9 game on Thursday Night against BAL are both projected lower and are consistent with his past lower performances. His slightly lower point totals when used_opponent_avg = 1 also make sense, given that he has prior statistics against those teams and his success/failures against them can be more accurately predicted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Dak Prescott        |                   281.102 |                    116.52 | QB         |               9 | Rating: 69/100. Dak Prescott's projection of 281.10 fantasy points seems a bit conservative given his history and the fact that the lagged stats, while showing some variability, don't point to a massive drop-off. His week-to-week projections show a consistent range, with most weeks hovering around the 17-18 point mark, though there is variance (e.g., week 1 at 15.98 points and week 3 at 17.97 points), not reflecting the boom-or-bust potential he has demonstrated in the past, possibly suppressing the season-long projection. Looking at the weeks where the used_opponent_avg is 1 (weeks 2, 14), the projected fantasy points don't show any noticeable change from when the used_opponent_avg is 0 (weeks 3, 4, 5), reflecting the lack of impact past opponent performance has on fantasy projections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The projection of 278.55 fantasy points is reasonable but somewhat conservative, placing him in the lower tier of starting quarterbacks despite demonstrated higher potential. There's a pattern of fluctuating weekly predictions, with some weeks (e.g., Week 7 against TB with 13.7 points) seemingly low given his lagged stats (307 passing yards) and others (e.g., Week 11 against PHI with 18.1 points) potentially inflated considering inconsistent prior performance. For example, his Week 11 prediction of 18.1 points seems ambitious given his average of 18.72 points in the training data, and his Week 7 prediction against TB seems low, especially given his higher-than-average yardage totals against TB in the past of 307 yards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Alvin Kamara is projected 286.01 fantasy points, which is a bit conservative considering his historical production and usage in the Saints' offense, but also reflecting a potential shift towards a more balanced attack with younger players emerging. The week-by-week projections show some inconsistencies, as weeks with favorable matchups (e.g., weeks 15 and 16 against Carolina and the Jets, respectively), have lower-than-expected projections relative to his lagged stats and the opponents' defensive vulnerabilities while other weeks show fairly high projections. For example, Kamara's lagged stats against Carolina in week 15 indicate strong past performance, yet his projected points are only 18.23, while other weeks against tougher opponents like the Bills, he is still projected a relatively high 18.62 fantasy points despite having lower lagged fantasy point totals overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Christian McCaffrey |                   253.567 |                     47.8  | RB         |               2 | Rating: 62/100. The projection of 253.57 fantasy points seems a bit low for a player of McCaffrey's caliber, especially considering he has had seasons with significantly higher point totals when healthy, suggesting the model may be underweighting his ceiling. The week-by-week predictions display some inconsistencies, with several weeks clustered around the 15-16 point range despite some favorable matchups and prior-season stats suggesting the potential for higher scores, particularly in weeks where his lagged receiving stats are high like week 6 against TB. For example, Weeks 1 and 6 both have a used_opponent_avg of 1, but the lagged stats in Week 6 are more favorable, yet the projection is only marginally higher, pointing to a lack of differentiation in predicting ceiling games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Jonathan Taylor is projected for 233.10 fantasy points, which seems slightly conservative given his past performances but still reasonable given the information available from lagged stats. Week-to-week predictions fluctuate, with some weeks showing lower point totals despite strong prior-season rushing stats, and others projecting higher scores despite less impressive prior performance. For example, in week 12 against KC, he's projected for 13.34 points despite 24 carries for 57 yards in the prior season (carries_lagged = 24, rushing_yards_lagged = 57), while in week 16 against SF, he's projected for 15.56 points following a season with 29 carries for 218 yards and 3 rushing touchdowns (carries_lagged = 29, rushing_yards_lagged = 218, rushing_tds_lagged = 3); some of this may be due to opponent adjustments, but it is not always clear and apparent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| David Montgomery    |                   229.838 |                    221.72 | RB         |               4 | Rating: 72/100. The projected 229.84 fantasy points seems reasonable, aligning with a solid RB2 performance but not quite an elite RB1, which is in line with the previous season-long stat totals used to predict this season. While most weekly predictions hover in the 13-15 point range, some weeks dip lower (e.g., Week 6 at 13.52 and Week 15 at 13.79), and these lower predictions contribute to a slightly lower overall season projection than if all weeks consistently mirrored the higher end of the 13-15 point range. Week 6 and Week 15, for example, seem low given that his lagged receiving stats are in line with weeks that project higher, suggesting that these weeks' predicted point totals may be a bit conservative and contributing to the total prediction being lower than what it could be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| James Conner        |                   229.665 |                    253.8  | RB         |               5 | Rating: 78/100. The projection of 229.66 PPR points seems reasonable for James Conner, aligning with a solid RB2 performance based on past seasons of similar players and his own lagged stats. The week-to-week predictions show some variance, with a few weeks projecting slightly higher, in the 15-16 point range (weeks 2, 15, 16), while others are lower, in the 12-14 point range (weeks 6, 7, 17), and that aligns with the variance of his lagged stats. Weeks 15 and 16 are expected to be high, in part because his rushing_yards_lagged and rushing_tds_lagged were higher in these weeks, especially with attempts to receive, while weeks 6 and 7 were low, owing to low rushing_yards_lagged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Kareem Hunt's predicted 216.40 points seems reasonable but slightly conservative, considering running backs with similar prior season stats often achieve higher season totals. The week-by-week predictions appear inconsistent, with some weeks like Week 6 against DET (14.88 points) and Week 17 against DEN (15.03 points) being higher than average despite only moderate lagged stats, while other weeks like Week 9 against BUF (12.42 points) are lower despite similar or better lagged performance. For example, his Week 17 projection is 15.03 against Denver despite having 35 rushing yards, 65 receiving yards in the prior season and no touchdowns, whereas Week 9 he is projected only 12.42 against Buffalo despite having 60 rushing yards in the prior season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Saquon Barkley      |                   214.697 |                    355.3  | RB         |               7 | Rating: 68/100. Saquon Barkley is projected 214.70 points, which is a reasonable total for a running back of his caliber, as his lagged stats from the previous season show him to be a solid, but not top-tier, fantasy performer. The week-by-week projections show decent consistency, but there are some weeks that appear to be slightly off, such as weeks 2 and 5 where he is projected for less than 13 points despite having solid receiving numbers and targets lagged from the previous season, and weeks 3 and 8 where he is projected for some of his highest totals despite similar opponent matchups. These inconsistencies between receiving and rushing projections and overall fantasy point predictions and opponent matchups might be contributing to the overall season-long prediction being slightly lower than expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Derrick Henry       |                   213.331 |                    306.3  | RB         |               8 | Rating: 72/100. Derrick Henry's projection of 213.33 points is moderate compared to top-tier running backs but seems reasonable given his age and potential decline in production, but his prior-season totals of 35.900002 down to 14.700000 the most recent year doesn't inspire confidence of a rebound back to his early-career form. Several weeks have noticeably lower point projections compared to his lagged stats, particularly weeks 4, 9, and 11, suggesting a potential undervaluation of his floor in favorable matchups, while weeks 3, 5, and 6 show point projections that may be slightly overvalued when considering the risk associated with age and potential wear and tear from previous seasons, and if he even still plays at the team by 2025 given his lack of previous season game logs with the Baltimore Ravens (BAL). For example, in week 4 against KC, he is projected just 12.08 points, despite prior-season success of 35.900002 with 13 carries for 46 yards and 1 touchdown, plus 0 receptions for 0 yards on 2 targets, while weeks 3, 5, and 6 against DET, HOU, and LA, respectively, are projected between 15.03 and 15.14 points, which may be slightly too optimistic considering the factors that could limit his overall ceiling (as touched upon in the first sentence). |

Breece Hall's projection of 212.94 fantasy points is a reasonable baseline, aligning with running back production, but it doesn't fully capitalize on his potential given the prior season stats of running and receiving for good yardage and having some touchdowns, which suggests a ceiling for higher performance. The week-to-week predictions show some inconsistencies, with weeks like Week 4 (12.19 points) and Week 6 (12.25 points) appearing low despite the lagged stats not indicating significant downturns or injuries, and weeks like Week 7 (15.17 points) seemingly too high, creating a muted, less dynamic prediction overall. The lower scoring weeks, such as Week 4 where he had -5.73 rushing EPA and -2.27 receiving EPA the previous season, are potentially dragging down the overall projection, despite other lagged metrics indicating a greater potential for higher weekly scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Rachaad White is projected for 211.67 fantasy points, which seems reasonable given his lagged stats but might be slightly optimistic considering the range of his previous season's weekly scores. Some weekly predictions seem a bit high, particularly weeks where his lagged receiving stats are low, which suggests a potential overestimation of his receiving contribution in those games. Weeks 6 and 11 predict 19.00 points each, despite his lagged receiving yards being modest in the prior season, suggesting these could be overestimations influencing the overall season total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Ja'Marr Chase       |                   261.747 |                    377.4  | WR         |               1 | Rating: 67/100. Ja'Marr Chase is projected to score 261.75 fantasy points, which seems a bit low for a player of his caliber and historical performance at the WR position. His week-to-week projections are somewhat inconsistent with significant variation, with some weeks projecting lower than might be expected based on his lagged stats, while other weeks have higher projections that are not fully supported by his past performances. For example, he has back-to-back weeks of projected scores 17.87 and 16.85 in Weeks 13 and 14, yet is projected a lower 15.85 in Week 17; additionally, weeks 13 and 14 have lower target_share_lagged, air_yards_share_lagged, and wopr_lagged scores than Week 17, contributing to the projected inconsistency throughout the season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Justin Jefferson    |                   247.198 |                    309.08 | WR         |               2 | Rating: 79/100. A total of 247.20 predicted fantasy points is reasonable, as he is an elite receiver, though his lagged stats reveal solid but not overwhelmingly dominant performances in the previous year. The week-by-week predictions show a good balance, with most weeks hovering around the 15-16 point range, which aligns with a consistent WR1 performance, however there are a few weeks that seem a bit low relative to his overall talent, such as week 1 (14.5 points) and week 10 (14.4 points). Week 1's prediction seems lower than it should be considering the targets_lagged (9.5) and receiving_yards_lagged (50.0) are not too bad; Week 10's lower prediction seems strange as well, considering it is nearly the same stats for targets_lagged (9.0) and receiving_yards_lagged (48.0), which might suggest an underestimation of his floor in favorable matchups or a conservative approach to projecting his performance against certain defenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

CeeDee Lamb is projected to score 242.58 points, which is a reasonable projection given his prior-season weekly fantasy points averages around 16-18 points in the training data provided, although not accounting for his improvement over time and his gradual increase in point totals per week. Week-by-week projections seem reasonable given the training data, with a few weeks being a bit too low in comparison to higher values of fantasy_points_ppr_lagged, such as week 3 where he is projected only 13.57 points with a fantasy_points_ppr_lagged of 17.40 and week 8 where he is projected only 15.05 points with a fantasy_points_ppr_lagged of 41.00. Similarly, his overall projection may be impacted by many weeks in the first half of the season having a 'used_game_number_avg' of 1 and lower projections of 13.57, 16.31, 14.64, and 15.87 in weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, where in similar weeks, the fantasy_points_ppr column is generally higher, in the 17-25 range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Mike Evans is predicted to score 238.85 points, which is reasonable given that his lagged receiving stats suggest he is a high-end WR2 or low-end WR1. The week-by-week predictions seem generally consistent, but weeks like Week 3 project a low 13.33 points, despite having a higher target share lagged (0.976744) than other weeks where he is projected to score 15+ points. In weeks 1, 5, and 15, against the same opponent, the projections are remarkably similar (15.21, 15.17, and 15.88 respectively), even though they are at different points in the season, which suggests consistency in the model but perhaps a lack of nuanced consideration for weekly variations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Terry McLaurin      |                   238.348 |                    247.6  | WR         |               5 | Rating: 72/100. The projection of 238.35 fantasy points is somewhat reasonable, aligning with a solid WR2 performance, though it depends heavily on his role and target share remaining consistent with his prior season's usage. McLaurin's week-to-week consistency seems to waver in the projections, as weeks where his lagged stats suggest a higher floor (e.g., weeks 3, 5, and 6, with high receiving yards lagged) don't necessarily translate to higher predicted scores, and the model seems to be overemphasizing negative matchups in some instances, especially given the positive lagged stats from the prior season. For instance, week 4 against ATL shows low expected fantasy production despite prior performance metrics not indicating a major decline, demonstrating an area where the week-to-week projections might be conservatively impacting the total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| A.J. Brown          |                   234.54  |                    216.9  | WR         |               6 | Rating: 68/100. A.J. Brown is predicted to score 234.54 fantasy points, which is a reasonable total for a WR1, considering his prior season averages and the averages of other WRs who were in comparable situations as him as it pertains to the lagged metrics. The week-by-week projections are generally consistent, with most weeks hovering in the 14-16 point range, but some weeks stand out as potentially miscalibrated: week 14 against LAC, where he is projected just 13.16 points despite a prior-season reception of 4, and week 17 against BUF, where he is projected 14.20 points despite a prior-season reception of only 3 and lower target numbers than other weeks in the schedule. These inconsistencies, however, don't appear to be significantly detrimental to the overall season-long total, but do seem to drag it down from the 250 point potential a receiver with his metrics from prior seasons would be expected to meet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Amon-Ra St. Brown   |                   234.106 |                    302.48 | WR         |               7 | Rating: 72/100. The 234-point projection for Amon-Ra St. Brown seems reasonable, placing him as a solid WR2 but lower than elite WR1 status, which aligns with his prior season performance given the lagged stats provided. His week-to-week projections show a generally consistent range with some fluctuations, but with no extreme highs or lows that significantly inflate or deflate his total, with few receiving performances in which he would be expected to carry a lineup for the week or sink it. Weeks 5 and 15 are projected low (13.22 and 12.94 points, respectively) despite similar lagged statistics to weeks where he is projected to score higher, such as weeks 6 and 7 (15.61 and 15.77 points, respectively), which contributes to the lower season-long projection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Tyreek Hill         |                   228.847 |                    214.2  | WR         |               8 | Rating: 72/100. Tyreek Hill is projected for 228.85 points, which is slightly lower than what a top-tier WR typically achieves, but within a reasonable range given the prior year's usage and production. The week-to-week projections fluctuate, with some weeks (e.g., Week 1 with 12.58 points) appearing lower than expected given his lagged stats, while other weeks (e.g., Week 14 with 16.14 points) seem more in line with his potential, possibly due to favorable matchups or higher target share in the previous year. Weeks like Week 1 and Week 3 both project around 13 points, despite one week being against a familiar opponent where he caught 3.5 receptions on 5.5 targets for 52 yards and the other being a new opponent where he had 1 reception on 5 targets for 5 yards, which makes the projection relatively similar for two completely different matchups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Chris Godwin        |                   227.732 |                    137.8  | WR         |               9 | Rating: 78/100. Chris Godwin is projected to score 227.73 points, which seems like a reasonable estimate based on his previous season performance and typical WR production. The week-by-week predictions appear mostly consistent, although weeks 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, and 17 have identical statistical inputs, suggesting the model might be over-relying on prior averages in the absence of differentiating data, slightly deflating some weekly projections. For example, weeks 10 and 16 have similar projections despite playing different opponents (NE and CAR, respectively) with potentially varying defensive matchups, further highlighting the model's reliance on averages rather than opponent-specific adjustments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Courtland Sutton    |                   222.82  |                    219.5  | WR         |              10 | Rating: 70/100. Courtland Sutton is projected to score 222.82 points, which seems reasonable but slightly conservative for a WR1 type player, especially given his target share and air yards share lagged stats. The week-by-week predictions show some inconsistency, with some weeks having higher projections when facing tougher opponents (KC in weeks 11 and 17) and lower projections against seemingly easier matchups (JAX in week 16). The model may be overvaluing opponent strength in some matchups and undervaluing Sutton's potential usage. For instance, Sutton's week 17 projection against KC is 13.87 points while his week 16 projection against JAX is 13.19, despite the KC game being on the road and JAX having a worse defense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Travis Kelce is projected to score 217.63 points, which is within range of past seasons but not at the high end for the top-performing tight ends in the league, suggesting a slightly conservative estimate. The week-by-week projections show some variability, with a noticeable dip in weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9, where Kelce is projected to score under 13 points despite decent lagged stats from the prior year, contributing to the somewhat tempered season-long prediction. For example, in week 9 against BUF, he's projected only 11.43 points despite a decent fantasy_points_ppr_lagged of 2.8, while weeks 7 and 8 see projections above 14 points with similar lagged stats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The predicted 187.37 fantasy points seems reasonable considering Kittle's prior season didn't showcase elite receiving numbers, and his lagged stats don't scream top-tier TE1 production. Some weekly predictions seem a bit inconsistent with his lagged production, with a few higher spikes relative to weeks where the opponent and game context is similar. For example, weeks 8 and 17 have identical lagged stats, yet week 8 projects higher at 13.27 points while week 17 projects lower at 11.85 points, despite both having used_opponent_avg = 0 and used_game_number_avg = 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Pat Freiermuth's projected total of 173.55 fantasy points seems reasonable but slightly conservative considering his past performances, and it is reasonable for a tight end. Some weekly predictions seem low given his lagged stats, specifically his receiving yards_lagged, targets_lagged, and receptions_lagged from prior seasons. For instance, weeks 14 and 16 project scores under 10 points despite reasonable targets, receptions, and receiving yards lagged, suggesting potential for higher scores given similar historical contexts, which contributes to the slight undervaluation of the season-long prediction. Weeks 14 and 16 both have similar receptions and targets lagged (around 3 receptions on 3 targets), but the corresponding receiving yards lagged for each (15 and 16, respectively) and projected fantasy points (both less than 10) don't quite line up with his other performances throughout the season where around 3 receptions on 3 targets converts to at least 10 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The projection of 167.47 PPR points seems reasonable for Mark Andrews, aligning with a mid-range TE1 performance based on his past seasons, though potentially slightly conservative. The week-to-week predictions appear somewhat inconsistent, with a mix of high and low scores that don't always correlate strongly with the lagged statistics, where weeks 4 and 14 are noticeably lower while weeks 6 and 16 are higher than expected given similar lagged statistics. For instance, week 4 against KC projects a low 9.53 points despite decent lagged receiving stats (2 receptions, 14 yards) which is not too far off from week 12 against NYJ (2 receptions, 22 yards) which projects 9.89 points, but week 16 against NE projects a high 12.08 points despite similar lagged receiving stats (4 receptions, 37 yards).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The predicted total of 164.45 fantasy points seems reasonable, placing him as a decent TE2 based on past tight end performances. The week-to-week predictions appear relatively consistent, with most weeks hovering around the 10-point mark, aligning with his prior season's stats and suggesting a reliable floor but limited ceiling, although weeks 10 and 16 are slightly higher given the receiving_tds_lagged is at 1.00 and his prior season total isn't too high. The consistency in projections, around 10 points per week, is mirrored by stable prior-season stats like receiving yards and receptions across different opponents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Hockenson is projected to score 163.93 fantasy points in 2025, which seems reasonable given the lack of prior season-long totals to be very impressive, especially given that prior seasons included in the training data are not of Hockenson himself (training data contains many entries of "DET" when this projection is only for "MIN"). The week-by-week point totals seem to align with this as well, with there not being any standout performances that are very high (none exceeding 11 points), which is realistic given his lagged stats, which are also not outstanding (generally below 70 receiving yards and less than 5 receptions). Weeks in which the used_opponent_avg = 1 seem to be particularly lower than expected, which might be part of the reason for his conservative season-long prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Dallas Goedert's predicted 152.99 points is a reasonable yet slightly conservative projection, considering typical TE1 production and his previous season's averages, yet he has not demonstrated significantly higher season-long totals in the past. The week-to-week predictions show consistency, but some weeks seem potentially undervalued, particularly given favorable matchups (e.g., weeks where used_opponent_avg = 1, DNP_prior_season_game = 0) and the performance data from the prior season (fantasy_points_ppr_lagged exceeding the 10-point average). For instance, the predictions for Weeks 1 and 12 against Dallas are identical (9.17 and 9.09 points, respectively), despite the limited production in prior weeks, while Week 4 against TB is a fairly high 10.66, which may be skewed based on the nature of the opponent or specific game context from the prior season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Brock Bowers is projected to score 147.04 points, which seems reasonable given his prior season's data showing weekly PPR scores typically ranging from 5 to 30 points. The week-by-week predictions appear somewhat volatile, with some weeks projecting lower scores despite favorable matchups (based on 'used_opponent_avg' and 'fantasy_points_ppr_lagged'), while other weeks show higher projections with seemingly less favorable conditions (based on 'used_opponent_avg' and 'fantasy_points_ppr_lagged'), but overall tend to average out to a reasonable season-long number. For instance, Week 4 against CHI at home projects only 8.64 points despite prior season data indicating a 5.10-point performance, and week 12 against CLE projects 8.56 points with similar prior season data indicating 5.10-point performance again; on the other hand, Week 11 against DAL at home projects 9.57 points with a prior season high score of 31.3 points, reflecting some inconsistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The predicted total of 142.40 fantasy points seems reasonable but perhaps slightly low given that similar lagged stats in the training data have resulted in higher outputs. Week-to-week predictions show some inconsistencies, with weeks 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 showing lower point projections than expected, especially considering the fantasy_points_ppr_lagged values are similar to weeks with much higher projected points. For instance, weeks 2 and 3 have lagged fantasy points around 11.3, but are projected only around 8 points each, while weeks 11 and 5 have similar lagged fantasy points and are projected slightly higher, pointing to some possible volatility/inconsistency that negatively weighs down overall point totals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The prediction of 137.43 fantasy points is reasonable but slightly conservative, given that even low-end starting tight ends often eclipse 150 points in PPR formats, and the lagged stats suggest Kincaid was a viable receiving threat. The week-to-week projections are fairly consistent, clustering around the 8-9 point range, which seems appropriate given the lagged receiving stats, although weeks with matchups against teams he faced previously with similar stat lines do not appear to boost projected points. For example, week 1 and week 4 have almost identical stat lines and opponents, yet the projections are different despite his receiving yards and receptions in the prior season being similar, which suggests an element of randomness or unaccounted-for variables is present.
